<h2>What can it do?</h2>

NotReaper is equipped with many tools and features to help you make Audica maps exactly how you
want in an as short amount of time as possible.

Here's some of the highlights.

</p>

* Direct loading, generating, and exporting of Audica files. No more hassle.
* A responsive and user friendly interface. Complete with 100% more animations.
* Drag all the things with Drag Select, your new best friend. Unless you hate productivity, that is.


## What is it?
NotReaper is a fork of a fork for the original AudicaEditor by Rolopogo.

Both previous versions stopped development, so I began work on NotReaper, which is basically a rewrite and rebuild of everything in it.

If none of that means anything to you, NotReaper is a custom map and community map builder for the VR ryhthm game, Audica.
