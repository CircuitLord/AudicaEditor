# NotReaper
"It's not reaper."

## What is it?
NotReaper is a fork of a fork for the original AudicaEditor by Rolopogo.

Both previous versions stopped development, so I began work on NotReaper, which is basically a rewrite and rebuild of everything in it.

If none of that means anything to you, NotReaper is a custom map and community map builder for the VR ryhthm game, Audica.

It's currently still in active development.
